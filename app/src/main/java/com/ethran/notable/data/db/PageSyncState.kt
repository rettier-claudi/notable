/**
 * Per-page sync bookkeeping, the page-level companion to [NotebookSyncState]. One row records what a
 * page looked like the last time it *committed* a sync, so the next sync can skip pages that have not
 * changed on either side: a page is uploaded only when its local edit is newer than
 * [syncedLocalUpdatedAt], and downloaded only when its remote ETag differs from [remoteEtag].
 *
 * Deliberately has **no** foreign key to [Page] (same reasoning as [NotebookSyncState]): the row
 * describes the last committed sync and is managed by the sync commit transaction, independent of the
 * local page row's lifecycle. Rows are written **only** inside the notebook's commit transaction
 * (after the manifest is published on upload / the atomic page swap on download); a killed sync
 * writes none, so the next sync re-transfers the same pages — "skip" stays as trustworthy as the
 * notebook badge.
