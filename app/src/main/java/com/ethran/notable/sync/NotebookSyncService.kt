     *  - different -> propagate [DomainError.SyncConflict]. The manifest is never published, nothing
     *    is committed, and the next sync re-reads the remote so the planner can decide
     *    download-vs-upload with fresh information.

     * every device then fails to parse — the same window the manifest closes with .tmp+MOVE
     * ([publishManifest]).
     *
     * The staging name carries a random suffix so two devices publishing the same page never share a
     * source file. A shared staging path is a data-loss race: device B could overwrite the bytes A
     * staged, then A MOVEs B's content while its *destination* guard still matches, records the move
     * as its own upload, and backfills the server's (B's) ETag — leaving A permanently "synced" to
     * content it never wrote. A unique source means each device only ever MOVEs its own bytes; the
     * loser's MOVE 412s on the now-changed destination and routes to [resolvePageConflict].
     *
     * The [ifMatch] guard rides the MOVE's destination precondition. A 412 there is a genuine
     * concurrent remote change and is settled by [resolvePageConflict] (byte-compare of our copy
     * against the remote) — but only when we actually sent a precondition; an unattributable 412
     * (weak/absent validator) falls through instead of being read as ours. When MOVE is unsupported
     * (405/501) or fails transiently, fall back to the direct guarded PUT (atomicity lost, ordering
     * preserved); its own 412 is resolved the same way.
     *
     * [createOnly] publishes a page believed absent: the MOVE is sent non-overwriting (`Overwrite: F`)
     * and unguarded, so a page another device created in the meantime makes the server reject the
     * publish. That rejection is a genuine concurrent create and is surfaced as
     * [DomainError.SyncConflict] — never content-resolved, since with no stored ETag there is nothing
     * to trust — so the caller aborts and re-plans. The MOVE-unsupported fallback carries [createOnly]
     * into the direct PUT's `If-None-Match: *` guard, preserving the same semantics.
     *
     * The MOVE path returns a null ETag — the destination's post-move ETag isn't reliably reported —
     * which [backfillMissingPageEtags] fills in with one PROPFIND so the skip path stays effective.
     * The staging file is deleted best-effort on failure; a MOVE consumes it on success, and any
     * leftover (hard crash before MOVE) is swept by the next upload's [garbageCollectRemote], which
     * deletes every pages-dir entry the committed manifest doesn't reference.
