## This fork (rettier-claudi/notable)

Personal fork for a Boox Note Air 5C that is one end of a WebDAV bridge (the other end writes
notebooks on the server). Everything below is on top of upstream `main`; upstream is tracked as
the `upstream` remote and merged in as it moves.

- **Fixed pages** — *Settings → General → "Fixed pages — disable scrolling"*: the canvas never
  moves at 100 % zoom (no drag scroll, no flick, no scroll indicators). Panning stays possible
  while zoomed so a zoomed page remains reachable.
- **Physical buttons / system gestures turn pages** — *Settings → Gestures → "Physical buttons
  turn pages"* (on by default): Volume up/down, Page up/down and D-pad keys go to the previous/next
  page while a notebook is open. On Boox, map a system side-swipe gesture to "page turn" or
  "volume" and it lands here as one of these keys. Keys keep their normal meaning in the library.
- **Sync when the app comes back to the foreground** — *Settings → Sync*: a full sync on every
  resume (device wake-up, app switch), rate-limited to one request per 30 s and skipped offline.
  Previously only a fresh app start synced, so a tablet that merely woke up never pulled changes.
- **Sync while in use every N minutes** (default 2, Off/1/2/5/10/15/30): a foreground poll that
  only runs while Notable is on screen. The ≥ 15 min WorkManager job stays the background fallback.
- **Sync indicator and button on the home screen** (top right, next to settings): state of the
  engine, time of the last successful sync, count of notebooks with unsynced edits or conflicts.
  Tap = "Sync now" / retry.
- **Toolbar buttons** `SYNC` (status icon: syncing = pressed, ✓ after success, ⚠ after an error;
  tap = sync now) and `SYNC_NOTIFY` (sync, wait for it to finish, then HTTP POST a small JSON to
  *Settings → Sync → Notify URL*; hidden without a URL). Both are in the default pinned zone and
  placeable via *Settings → Toolbar* for custom layouts. Body:
  `{"source":"notable","event":"sync-and-notify","pageId":…,"notebookId":…,"syncSucceeded":true,"time":"…Z"}`.
- **Sync when leaving the app** (*Settings → Sync*, default on): a full sync on `onStop`, not
  rate-limited, so the last strokes are on the server before the tablet sleeps.
- **Quick pages sync** (*Settings → Sync*, default on): pages without a notebook are uploaded
  one-way to `notable/quickpages/<pageId>.json` (images under `quickpages/images/`) whenever they
  change; a quick page deleted on the device is deleted on the server. The only thing taken from
  the server is a deletion: remove the page file there and the page disappears on the device —
  unless it was edited since its last upload, then it is re-uploaded instead. Meant for a server-side
  consumer that ingests scribbled notes and then removes them.
- **Page replaced by a download while open**: within 10 s after start/wake-up (the resume sync)
  the canvas reloads silently; later a snack offers "Reload", so the wake-up sync never turns
  into a conflict with an untouched page.
- Sync bug fixes found with a server-side writer:
  - A notebook downloaded in a sync run was tombstoned and deleted from the server one second
    later (`detectAndUploadLocalDeletions` compared sync-state rows against the pre-download
    snapshot only) and then re-uploaded by the next run.
  - Synced image backgrounds rendered white: the relative name stored by sync was opened as-is.
    Relative names now resolve against the managed `backgrounds/` folder.
  - Synced image elements ("cannot load PNG"): sync stores a plain absolute path, which the
    content resolver cannot open. Scheme-less paths are decoded straight from the file.
  - Sync log keeps 300 lines instead of 50.

Build: `./gradlew assembleRelease` with `STORE_FILE`/`STORE_PASSWORD`/`KEY_ALIAS`/`KEY_PASSWORD`
set (own keystore; the APK is not installable over the upstream build, uninstall that first —
notebooks live in `Documents/notabledb` and survive, sync credentials must be re-entered).
Releases: https://github.com/rettier-claudi/notable/releases

## About This Fork
This project began as a fork of the original Notable app and has since evolved into a continuation of it. The architecture is largely the same, but many of the functions have been rewritten and expanded with a focus on practical, everyday use. Development is active when possible, guided by the principle that the app must be fast and dependable — performance comes first, and the basics need to feel right before new features are introduced. Waiting for things to load is seen as unacceptable, so responsiveness is a core priority.

Future plans include exploring how AI can enhance the app, with a focus on solutions that run directly on the device. A long-term goal is local handwriting conversion to LaTeX or plain text, making advanced features available without relying on external services.

---

## Features
* ⚡ **Fast page turns with caching:** smooth, swift page transitions, including quick navigation to the next and previous pages.
* ↕️ **Infinite vertical scroll:** a virtually endless canvas for notes with smooth vertical scrolling.
* 📝 **Quick Pages:** instantly create a new page.
* 📒 **Notebooks:** group related notes and switch easily between notebooks.
* 📁 **Folders:** organize notes with folders.
* 🤏 **Editor mode gestures:** [intuitive gesture controls](#gestures) to enhance editing.
* 🌅 **Images:** add, move, scale, and remove images.
* ➤ **Selection export:** export or share selected handwriting as PNG.
* ✏️ **Scribble to erase:** erase content by scribbling over it (disabled by default) — contributed by [@niknal357](https://github.com/niknal357).
* 🔄 **Auto-refresh on background change:** useful when using a tablet as a second display — see [Working with LaTeX](#working-with-latex).

## Gestures
Notable features intuitive gesture controls within Editor mode to optimize the editing experience:

#### ☝️ 1 Finger
* **Swipe up or down:** scroll the page.
* **Swipe left or right:** change to the previous/next page (only available in notebooks).
* **Double tap:** undo.
* **Hold and drag:** select text and images.

#### ✌️ 2 Fingers
* **Single tap:** switch between writing and eraser modes.
* **Pinch:** zoom in and out.
* **Drag:** move the canvas.

#### 🤟 3 Fingers
* **Swipe left or right:** show or hide the toolbar.
* **Swipe up:** open QuickNav (can be disabled in Gesture settings).

> ⚠️ **Caveat:** on Onyx devices, a three-finger swipe is also the system's screenshot gesture, which can steal the touch before Notable sees it. Enabling **"Block system gestures while in Notable"** in Gesture settings fixes this, but as a side effect, edge-navigation swipes (e.g. back/recent-apps) stop working while the app is open.

#### 🔲 Selection
* **Drag:** move the selection.
* **Double tap:** copy the selected writing.

## System Requirements and Permissions
The app targets Onyx BOOX devices and requires Android 10 (SDK 29) or higher. Limited support for Android 9 (SDK 28) may be possible if [issue #93](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/93) is resolved. Handwriting functionality is currently not available on non-Onyx devices. Enabling handwriting on other devices may be possible in the future but is not supported at the moment.

Storage access is required to manage notes, assets, and to observe PDF backgrounds, which need “all files access”. The database is stored at `Documents/notabledb` to simplify backups and reduce the risk of accidental deletion. Exports are written to `Documents/notable`.

---

## Export and Import

The app supports the following formats:

- **PDF** — export and import supported. You can also link a page to an external PDF so that changes on your computer are reflected live on the tablet (see [Working with LaTeX](#working-with-latex)).  
- **PNG** — export supported for handwriting selections, individual pages, and entire books.  
- **JPEG** — export supported for individual pages.  
- **XOPP** — export and import partially supported. Only stroke and image data are preserved; tool information for strokes may be lost when files are opened and saved with [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/). Backgrounds are not exported.  


---

## Roadmap
This is a rough, unordered list of ideas and in-progress work, not a committed schedule — priorities shift depending on what's needed at the time.

- Currently being worked on:
  - Customizable toolbar: allow modifying which tools appear and in what order.
  - Non-Onyx device support: make Notable usable on other Android devices, without depending on the Onyx SDK.
- Sync: groundwork already exists in the codebase, but it's not ready for use yet.
- Better selection tools:
  - Stroke editing (color, size, etc.)
  - Rotate and flip selection
  - Auto‑scroll when dragging a selection near screen edges
  - Easier selection movement, including dragging while scrolling
- PDF improvements:
  - Allow saving annotations back to the original PDF
  - Improved rendering and stability across devices
- PDF annotation enhancements:
  - Display annotations from other programs
  - Additional quality‑of‑life tools for annotating imported PDFs
- Bookmarks, tags, and internal links — see [issue #52](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/52), including link export to PDF.
- Figure and text recognition — see [issue #44](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/44):
  - Searchable notes
  - Automatic creation of tag descriptions
  - Shape recognition
  - Handwriting to Latex

## Troubleshooting and FAQ
**What are “NeoTools,” and why are some disabled?**
NeoTools are components of the Onyx E-Ink toolset, made available through Onyx’s libraries. However, certain tools are unstable and can cause crashes, so they are disabled by default to ensure better app stability. Examples include:

* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoCharcoalPenV2`
* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoMarkerPen`
* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoBrushPen`

## Bug Reporting

If you encounter unexpected behavior, please include an app log with your report. To do this:  
1. Navigate to the page where the issue occurs.  
2. Reproduce the problem.  
3. Open the page menu.  
4. Select **“Bug Report”** and either copy the log or submit it directly.  

This will open a new GitHub issue in your browser with useful device information attached, which greatly helps in diagnosing and resolving the problem.  

Bug reporting with logs is currently supported only in notebooks/pages. Issues outside of writing are unlikely to require this level of detail.

## Working with LaTeX

The app can be used as a **primitive second monitor** for LaTeX editing — previewing compiled PDFs
in real time on your tablet.

### Steps:

- Connect your device to your computer via USB (MTP).
- Set up automatic copying of the compiled PDF to the tablet:
  <details>
  <summary>Example using a custom <code>latexmkrc</code>:</summary>

  ```perl
  $pdf_mode = 1;
  $out_dir = 'build';

  sub postprocess {
      system("cp build/main.pdf '/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=DEVICE/Internal shared storage/Documents/Filename.pdf'");
  }

  END {
      postprocess();
  }
  ```
  
  It was also tested with `adb push`, instead of `cp`.

  </details>
- Compile, and test if it copies the file to the tablet.
- Import your compiled PDF document into Notable, and choose to observe the PDF file.

> After each recompilation, Notable will detect the updated PDF and automatically refresh the view.

---

## App Distribution
Notable is not distributed on Google Play or F-Droid. Official builds are provided exclusively via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/releases).

---

## For Developers & Contributing

- Project file layout: see [docs/file-structure.md](./docs/file-structure.md)  
- Data model and stroke encoding: see [docs/database-structure.md](./docs/database-structure.md)  
- Additional documentation will be added as needed  
  Note: These documents were AI-generated and lightly verified; refer to the code for the authoritative source.

### Development Notes

- Edit the `DEBUG_STORE_FILE` in `/app/gradle.properties` to point to your local keystore file. This is typically located in the `.android` directory.
- To debug on a BOOX device, enable developer mode. You can follow [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/i1kb2UQ).

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I appreciate your help!
